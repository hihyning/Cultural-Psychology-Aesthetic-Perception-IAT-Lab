                    <h2>Debriefing Statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thank you for participating! This study is part of my personal and academic research project which investigates how <a href=https://humaans.io/hr-glossary/culture-models target="_blank">cultural models</a> and the authority of design education shape our <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ target="_blank">aesthetic judgments</a>.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>What Was This Study About?</h2>
                    <p>
                        You took part in a variant of the <a href=https://edib.harvard.edu/implicit-association-test-iat target="_blank">Implicit Association Test (IAT)</a>, which is used to measure unconscious associations people hold between subjects. In this case, you were asked to categorise visual designs and evaluative words as either “East/West" or “Good/Bad" under timed conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal was to see whether individuals from different cultural or design backgrounds more readily associate certain visual styles (East Asian vs. Western) with positive or negative qualities—and how quickly and accurately they do so. We also explored whether prior exposure to design systems or formal training influenced these associations.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Why Is This Important?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Aesthetic preference is often seen as subjective or universal, while “seeing” itself is commonly assumed to be an objective process. However, psychological research reveals that <strong>our perception of beauty and style is deeply shaped by culture, familiarity, and lived experience</strong>. This study contributes to the growing field of cultural psychology by examining how visual recognition and cultural values intersect—particularly in the context of globalised design. By studying how we associate meaning with visual forms, we begin to question what it really means to “see” design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your participation helps us better understand how different audiences engage with visual systems, which has implications for design education, cross-cultural communication, and globalised design practices.
